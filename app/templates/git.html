<p><b>GIT:</b>Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management in software development. Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.</p>
<p> <b>Branches:</b> Branch in Git is used to keep the changes until they are ready. One can do the work on a branch while the main branch (master) remains stable. After the job is done with a certain project, once can merge it with the main office. Here's a link to highlight how multiple branches of a certain repository looks like:
<ul> <li><a href = "https://github.com/nahian-29/project1-flask/branches/all">Branches Demo</a> </li> </ul> </p>
<p><b>GIT Merge:</b> Merge in GIT is a way of putting a forked history back together again. The GIT merge command lets one take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches. git merge takes two commit pointers, usually the branch tips, and will find a common base commit between them. Once Git finds a common base commit it will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes of each queued merge commit sequence.</p>
<p><b>GIT Commit:</b> The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. Prior to the execution of git commit. At a high-level, Git can be thought of as a timeline management utility. Commits are the core building block units of a Git project timeline. Commits can be thought of as snapshots or milestones along the timeline of a Git project. Commits are created with the git commit command to capture the state of a project at that point in time. Git Snapshots are always committed to the local repository. The working copy is committed to the central repository.</p>
<p><b>GIT Tags:</b> Git Tags are specific reference points in the Git history. Git tags are used to capture the specific point in the history that is further used to point to a released version. A tag does not change like a branch. They don’t have a further history of commits after being created. Git Tags are used to give some meaningful name to a particular in the git project repository. Suppose two users decide to tag their project code for access later.</p>

<p><b>GIT Repository:</b> Repositories in GIT contain a collection of files of various different versions of a Project. These files are imported from the repository into the local server of the user for further updations and modifications in the content of the file. A VCS or the Version Control System is used to create these versions and store them in a specific place termed as a repository. The process of copying the content from an existing Git Repository with the help of various Git Tools is termed as cloning. Once the cloning process is done, the user gets the complete repository on his local machine. Git by default assumes the work to be done on the repository is as a user, once the cloning is done.
Users can also create a new repository or delete an existing repository. </p>
